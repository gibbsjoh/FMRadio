# General guide and caveats

* How to run this solution (standalone)
  - On iPhone/iPad, get FileMaker Go from the App Store. Copy FMRadio.fmp12 to your device (you can just put it in iCloud or probably OneDrive etc)
  - Open the file and have at it!

* How to run (hosted)
  - This requires FileMaker Server or FileMaker Cloud
  - I assume if you have this, you know how to add solutions to the server!
  - Then open from the server or via WebDirect
 
* Caveats
  - Personal playlists (eg a M3U with a set of music files) must be EXTM3U at the moment
    - Playback links must be https, http throws an error I can't get around at the moment
