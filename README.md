Streaming audio app in FileMaker using JavaScript.

The HTML and Javascript are embedded in the fmp12 file, but are provided separately in the resources directory as well for version control / ease of editing

The username/password is admin/password - FileMaker Server requires a password for files so it's already there if you want to host it on FMS

The JS pulls in HLS.js which is (c) DailyMotion and licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
